// Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
// or vendor/assets/javascripts of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.

// It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
// compiled file.

// Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details

// Will include every Javascript file in this folder on every page.

// This can do two different things:
//
// - production: cat all files into one
// - development: nothing. `_link` methods link to multiple files automatically.

// In the default template becase it is the best option for all websites:
// let the browser load all javascript once, and then use it from cache fora all webpages.
