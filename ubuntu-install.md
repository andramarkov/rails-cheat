# Ubuntu install

Install Rails on Ubuntu with Ruby RVM: <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/articles/how-to-install-ruby-on-rails-on-ubuntu-12-04-lts-precise-pangolin-with-rvm>

Should work for most other Linux distros as well.

The line which has been put on `~/.bash_profile` in the tutorial should be moved to `~/.bashrc` instead.

Will also need Node.js:

    sudo aptitude install nodejs

or even better, use NVM.
