# This file will be `instance_evaled` into the main Gemfile.

# This file contains Gemset settings which vary from deploy to deploy.
# and it is not even possible to differentiate between them via environment variables.
#
# This is the case for example of Heroku + pg: you must locally run bundle install
# after changing the file to generate a new Gemfile.lock which will be uploaded.
#
# It would therefore not be possible to decide based on environment variables
# since the command must be run locally.
